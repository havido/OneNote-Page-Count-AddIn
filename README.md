# OneNote-Page-Count-AddIn
I stored all the job descriptions that I applied to in OneNote, but it doesn't seem like there's any way to count # of pages in the current section, so I'm making this for that purpose. So curious to see how many jobs I've applied to, I bet it exceeded 500 :( (Update: it was 518 when I ran the tool for the first time...)
